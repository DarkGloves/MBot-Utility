</div>

### üè° Main Menu
When the MBot starts up, you will be taken to the Main Menu.  
From here, you can enter any mode pressing its respective button in the IR controller:

<div align='center'>

| Mode | Button |
|:----:|:-----:|
|Mode A|![A](https://placehold.co/25x25/000/0FF?text=A)|
|Mode B|![B](https://placehold.co/25x25/000/0FF?text=B)|
|Mode C|![C](https://placehold.co/25x25/000/0FF?text=C)|
|Mode D|![D](https://placehold.co/25x25/000/0FF?text=D)|
|Mode E|![E](https://placehold.co/25x25/000/0FF?text=E)|
  
</div>

### ![A](https://placehold.co/15x15/000/0FF?text=A) Mode A

In this mode, you will be able to move your MBot with your IR controller, as if it was RC car.

For this you can press these buttons:

<div align=center>

| Button | Action |
|:----:|:-----:|
|A|Return to the main menu|
|‚ñ≤|Go forward|
|‚ñº|Go backwards|
|‚óÄ|Turn left|
|‚ñ∂|Turn right|
|1 ~ 9| Modify the speed|

</div>

### ![B](https://placehold.co/15x15/000/0FF?text=B) Mode B

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to connect the Ultrasonic sensor to port 2.

> [!WARNING]  
> It's potentially dangerous to place your MBot in an elevated position on this mode, **It could fall over!**

In this mode, your MBot will change its path each time it detects an object in front of it.<br><br>
Actions:

<div align=center>

| Button | Action |
|:----:|:-----:|
|A|Return to the main menu|
|1 ~ 9| Modify the speed|

</div>

### ![C](https://placehold.co/15x15/000/0FF?text=C) Mode C

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to connect the line follower sensor to port 3.

In this mode, your MBot will act as a *line follower*.  
If you want toplay with it, you will need tracks. If you don't own any line-follower tracks, you can take a look at these [free printable tracks.](https://github.com/DarkGloves/MBot-Utility/tree/main/resources/printable_tracks)   

Once you have a track, you just need to place the line follower module above the black path and it will automatically start following it.  

Actions:

<div align=center>

| Button | Action |
|:----:|:-----:|
|A|Return to the main menu|
|1 ~ 9| Modify the speed|

</div>

### ![D](https://placehold.co/15x15/000/0FF?text=D) Mode D

In this mode, your MBot will be restricted to an area, and each time it touches a corner, it will change its path randomly.  

For specifying the area, you can use black tape: mark the boundaries with a line. Then, place the MBot in the center, and each time it touches the tape, it will change its path  

Actions:

<div align=center>

| Button | Action |
|:----:|:-----:|
|A|Return to the main menu|
|1 ~ 9| Modify the speed|

</div>

### ![E](https://placehold.co/15x15/000/0FF?text=E) Mode E

In this mode, you are able to listen to music. There are actually 2 avaiable tracks, hope you like them!

<div align=center>

| Button | Action / Song|

## üì¶ Restoring the default program
For restoring MBot's default program, you can just flash the `mbot_factory_firmware.ino` file from the [lastest release](https://github.com/DarkGloves/MBot-Utility/releases/latest/download/mbot_factory_firmware.ino), extracted from the MBlock 3 software, al credits to [Makeblock-official](https://github.com/Makeblock-official).
